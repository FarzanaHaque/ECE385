The purpose of this lab was to implement an 8-bit serial logic processor and three adders on an FPGA, using SystemVerilog.

 For this lab, we were given SystemVerilog code for a 4-bit serial logic processor. Our task was to extend the logic processor to 8 bits. The logic processor has similar functionality to our design in lab 3. It takes two 8-bit words and performs one of eight bitwise logical operations on them. 

The three ripple adders we implemented add two 16-bit words A and B. The carry-select and carry-lookahead adders include modifications to improve the speed at which the inputs are processed to produce valid outputs. 

Both the serial logic processor and the three adders take inputs from the switches and buttons and create LED and hex driver outputs.
